The course covers 4 main units: Drawing with Shapes, Basic Animations, Giving Programs Options, and Animating Lots of Shapes. At the end of the course, each student will be able to develop their own game using Python."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"template","props":{"v-slot:syllabus":""},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"em","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Syllabus coming soon!"}]}]}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"certificate-notice","props":{},"children":[]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:courses:game-programming-with-python.md","_source":"content","_file":"courses/game-programming-with-python.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"hxzEY8MQPe"}

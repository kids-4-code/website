::course-descrip

Java 3 is our highest-level Java course and is intended for students who have a firm grasp on the material covered in our previous two courses and are ready to take their understanding to the next level. Itâ€™s designed to cover a wide range of different topics, from commonly used algorithms to object-oriented programming to debugging skills. Students may find this class slightly more difficult & conceptual than Java 1 and Java 2.

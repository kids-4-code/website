::course-descrip
Due to limited interest we will not be offering this course Summer 2025.
In this course, you’ll learn to create user interfaces that are intuitive, easy to use, and aesthetically pleasing. If you've ever wanted to learn how to make your own apps or websites look better, this is the class for you!

You’ll learn how to approach the design of an interface, the key concepts that underlie the design of the software we interact with every day, and then how to create your own designs in Figma, a popular web-based prototyping/wireframing tool that is used by the majority of designers today. By the end of the course, you should have a few projects you can take away and the foundational knowledge required to go on and learn even more!

Compared to most of our other classes, this class is relatively low-code. However, design is an important part of the overall development of any product, so learning UI design might make you a better, more well-rounded developer overall.

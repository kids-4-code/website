Python 2 builds on the material covered in Python 1A/1AB, taking students on a deeper journey into the Python programming language. It includes crucial concepts like functions, lists, string manipulation, and file I/O that are essential for more creating complex applications.

In addition, a solid foundation in these universal programming concepts can then be applied to many other popular programming languages.

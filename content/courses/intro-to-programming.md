::course-descrip

This course is designed for students who plan to take AP Computer Science Principles in high school and want a strong head start. It introduces key topics such as programming fundamentals, algorithms, data, and the impact of computing on society. While it does not cover the full AP curriculum due to time constraints, the course provides a solid foundation and builds confidence in core concepts to support success in the official AP CSP class.

Students will learn to think like a programmer and solve problems using code in a fun and engaging way using Scratch.

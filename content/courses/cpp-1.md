::course-descrip

Covers basic programming concepts in C++, a powerful, performant, and widely used programming language.

Note that since C++ concepts / syntax can be more difficult to understand, we recommend young children or those with no previous programming experience take one of our introductory programming classes like Python 1A/1AB.

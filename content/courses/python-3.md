::course-descrip

Python 3 provides an in-depth overview of object-oriented programming & data structures, completing our basic Python track. Students will enhance their ability to write concise & well-structured code through classes, list, and dictionary comprehensions, and explore some simple debugging techniques to make their coding journeys smoother. The course will conclude with a final project, allowing students to apply what they have learned by building a project of their choice with guidance from teachers.

				Q: Are there any required course materials?
			</h3>
			<p>No — everything is provided by Kids for Code for free.</p>
			<hr class="my-4" />
			<h3 class="font-serif font-bold text-lg mb-2 mt-4">
				Q: Can I change what course I registered for?
			</h3>

			<p>
				If you'd like to change your course selections, please reach out
				to us at kidsforcodeteam@gmail.com.

			<h3 class="font-serif font-bold text-lg mb-2 mt-4">
				Q: Will students be able to ask questions outside of class?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Yes, students can ask questions in the Google Classroom for
				their class and one of our teachers for that class should be
				able to answer it.

				Q: (Maryland only) Can I get SSL hours for teaching?
			</h3>
			<p>
				We're currently still working on nonprofit status in Maryland,
				but after that's completed, we will be able to issue SSL hours
				for teaching classes.

			<h3 class="font-serif font-bold text-lg mb-2 mt-4">
				Q: Can I sign up for classes even if I haven't taken the
				previous ones?
			</h3>
			<p>
				We don't enforce prerequisites — however we do recommend that
				you take previous classes before signing up for more advanced
				ones (for example, we'd reccomend taking Python 1 before you
				take Python 2).
				<br />
				If you do think you're ready to take a more advanced class &
				know all the material from the previous ones (you can review the
				course descriptions & syllabus to get an idea of what is
				taught), feel free to go ahead and sign up!

				Q: Do parents need to be present during classes?
			</h3>
			<p>Parents don't need to be present during classes.</p>

			<h3 class="font-serif font-bold text-lg mb-2 mt-4">
				Q: Will I need a computer to take classes?
			</h3>
			<p>
				A laptop or desktop of some kind is greatly preferred
				(Chromebooks are fine). Our curriculum is designed around
				<a
					class="font-semibold underline"
					href="https://repl.it"
					target="_blank"
					>repl.it ↗</a
				>, an online code editor. While it does work on tablets & mobile
				devices, it is significantly more difficult to use & not
				recommended.
			</p>

			<h3 class="font-serif font-bold text-lg mb-2 mt-4">
				Q: Are there homework assignments?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Yes, students will be given coding assignments to work on
				between classes, which will be turned in for feedback from our
				teachers.
